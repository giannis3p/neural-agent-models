# From Simulations to Surrogates: Neural Networks Enhancing Burn Wound Healing Predictions

- <code>Figures/</code>: Contains the figures used in the manuscript.
- <code>auxiliary/</code>: Collection of supplementary material.
- <code>data/</code>: Contains data files required to run the code as well as data files generated from the neural networks.
- <code>scripts/</code>: Contains the scripts used to train the neural networks.

# Installation

Python 3.8.0 and the following are required to run this code:

pip install tensorflow==2.10.0 <br /> 
pip install matplotlib==3.7.4 <br /> 
pip install scipy==1.10.1 <br /> 
pip install pandas==2.0.3 <br /> 
pip install deepxde==1.10.1 <br /> 
pip install numpy==1.24.3 <br /> 
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.2 <br /> 

The scripts for 50x50 grid dimensions should be able to be run locally on most computers, however running on HPC is recommended for 100x100 and higher.

If you want to run on GPU the compatible CUDA versions with Python 3.8.0 are:

CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1

# How to run

To reproduce our experiments you can find the data generated by CompuCell3D in <code>data/simulation_data/</code>. Then in <code>scripts/</code>: you can find the Python files used to train the NNs, where you simply have to alter the file paths and run the files.
